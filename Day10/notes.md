difference between print and return
    Printing means displaying a value in the console. To print a value in Python, you call the print() function. After printing a value, you can no longer use it.
    Returning is used to return a value from a function and exit the function. To return a value from a function, use the return keyword. You can use the returned value later by storing it in a variable.
