Finding the length of strings
 -- len()
 gives the length of the characters and works only characters capped in quotes.

Python Primitive data types
 -- strings
 # Ex:("Hello")
 If you want the index in a string is called subscript.
 --print("Hello"[0])
 ~ Output : H


 Integer
 Integer is a whole number no matter positive or negative without any decimal point.
 # print(1234)
 ~ Output: 1234

 Float
 A number with decimal place is called float.
 # print(3.123)
 ~ Output: 3.123

 Boolean
 These are decision makers which consist of either True or False
 # True
 # False

Type Casting
To convert the data type into different data type.
~ Ex: string = input("What is your name? ") -- This is Int by default
    str(number) -- by using type casting we converted Int to String.
