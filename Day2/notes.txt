Finding the length of strings
 -- len()
 gives the length of the characters and works only characters capped in quotes.

Python Primitive data types
 -- strings
 # Ex:("Hello")
 If you want the index in a string is called subscript.
 --print("Hello"[0])
 ~ Output : H


 Integer
 Integer is a whole number no matter positive or negative without any decimal point.
 # print(1234)
 ~ Output: 1234

 Float
 A number with decimal place is called float.
 # print(3.123)
 ~ Output: 3.123

 Boolean
 These are decision makers which consist of either True or False
 # True
 # False

Type Casting
To convert the data type into different data type.
~ Ex: name = input("What is your name? ") -- 
    print(type(string)) -- checking the type of name
    str(name) -- by using type casting we converted Int to String.


Operators
+ -- adds the values
- -- Subtracts the values
* -- Multiply the values
/ -- divides the values and return the output in float.
** -- exponent 2 ** 3 = 8

When you have more than 1 math operation then the program excutes according to the priority.
    PEMDASLR - order of priority
    () - Parentheses
    E - exponent
    M - Multiplication     D - Division
        Same priority but whatever is on the left will be calculated first
    A - Addition   S - Subtraction
        Same priority but whatever is on the left will be calculated first
    L - Left  to R - Right


round is used for rounding the number.
    ~Ex: print(round(8 / 3 , 2))
    --  2 gives us 2 numbers after decimal point.

Shorthands
    score = 0
    score += 1
    print(score)
    ~output: 1

F string
When we are using different data types to print , we have to first convert them into the string and then print the statement with values.
To solve that we have f string where it takes all the data without conversion and gives us the output
    --Syntax print(f"Always f  should {int} be  outside touch{float} of quotes")
