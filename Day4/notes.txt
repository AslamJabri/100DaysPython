Modules
Split instruction and pack in a py document and use it in the python put.
For creating a modules we create a file and write the set of instruction into that file.
After writing instruction we import that file into our main file :
-- import modulename
    a = modulename.data

Lists
it is a data structure. a way to organise the data where we can store group pieces of data.
 ~Ex: fruits = ["apple", "jackfruit", "orange"]
 print(fruits[0])
 ~Output:  apple
 this is a list of fruits and it is in order where we can access each item in the list.
if we use [-1] then the list is started from reverse.
print(fruits[-1])
 ~Output:  orange

 The data in the list is mutable which means you can change the data by getting the index.
 there are many other functions with list which comes in handy like append,extend and many more.


 IndexError
 When there is an Index out of the range of the list.always use -1 as offset with len of list.
