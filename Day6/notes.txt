Making a function:
    def function_name():
        print("Hello")
        print("Bye")

now that we have created a function. now we need to call the function.
    function_name()



Indentation 
for everything in python there is indentation and it is very important to indent.
use 4 spaces for indentation. According to python documentation we have to use 4 spaces rather than tabs.

While loops
while (something_is_true):
    do something
there is also another syntax for while
    while not True:
        do this
In this version it waits for it to get true and eventually stop the loop.

When you want to iterate over something and do something with each of the item use for loop .
When you dont care about number and not cared about list then use while loop.
Note: It happens to create infinite loop .so take care of while condition.
